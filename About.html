    <h1>About Our Food Donation System</h1>

    <p>
        Every day, countless restaurants prepare more food than is consumed. At the same time, 
        many communities and charities struggle to provide enough meals to those in need. 
        Our Food Donation System bridges this gap by connecting restaurants with surplus food 
        to charities that require it.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        To reduce food wastage and fight hunger by creating a simple, reliable, and 
        transparent platform where restaurants and charities can collaborate for social good.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Restaurants list the food they have available along with the pickup time. 
        Charities can then view the available donations and claim the ones that 
        match their needs and location. The system ensures that food reaches the 
        right place at the right time.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        By reducing food waste and redirecting it to those who need it most, 
        we not only help fight hunger but also contribute to a sustainable future. 
        Together, we can make a real differenceâ€”one meal at a time.
