    <h1>Join Us</h1>
    <p>
        Together, we can make a difference. Whether you are a restaurant owner, a charity representative, 
        or simply someone who cares about reducing food waste and fighting hunger, there’s a place for you in our mission.
    </p>

    <h2>For Restaurants</h2>
    <p>
        If you own or manage a restaurant, you can contribute by donating surplus food. 
        Our system allows you to list food availability along with pickup times, so it can reach 
        nearby charities that need it most.
    </p>

    <h2>For Charities</h2>
    <p>
        If you represent a charity or community organization, you can register to receive 
        donations from local restaurants. You’ll be able to find food that matches your needs and location.
    </p>

    <h2>For Individuals</h2>
    <p>
        Even if you don’t run a restaurant or charity, you can still help. 
        Spread the word, volunteer with local food drives, or connect us with organizations that could benefit 
        from our system.
    </p>
